# Rolling Valley Member Sign-In System

When my neighborhood pool made the shift from paper sign-in to a computer sign-in system, the pool booard intended to increase efficiency, but instead they were met with patron frustration. Additionally, the software they used initially was terribly expensive. To help out this place of my childhood and my community, I thought it would be fun to make some new software. This was the result.
